We picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away!  When we realized that we simply couldn't find it anywhere in our city we were bummed.<br /><br />Now, because of the magic of the internet, we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of it.<br /><br />If you love hot sauce..I mean really love hot sauce, but don't want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat, grab a bottle of Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan.  Just realize that once you taste it, you will never want to use any other sauce.<br /><br />Thank you for the personal, incredible service! \n",

       " 'i was getting very worried, when i read some of the other reviews here.  specifically, the \"one star\" reviews, to which i always go, to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying it.wow!  they sure seemed to hate the kettle chips, backyard barbecue 9-ounce bags, (pack of 12), that i had bought as 1 ounce bags, liked a lot, decided to subscribe....and then, for good measure, got 2 orders of the 9 ounce bags.yes...i love potato chips....especially these kettle chips, backyard barbecue flavour....but others seemed to really hate them...or at least, hate how they had changed.but then i realized they were talking about other flavours!  amazon, in  it is deep wisdom, has obviously seen fit to put all comments concerning all flavours of kettle, (and other brands of?????) potato chips, together!of course, this does have some advantages, because most potato-chip lovers, (like me!), enjoy eating several flavour, and brand varieties.  so, comparisons can be made easily.  also, as we are all potato-chip lovers, but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing, we are, here a sort of \"united nations of potato chip lovers\"....all different, but all united in our love of potato chips!  (the rest of the world can really benefit from the example of our tightly-knit, but ever...er,...expanding...group here, i think! : )  but -- not at first realizing that thesedifferent flavour reviews were all together, did cause me a little confusion and dismay.... at least to begin with.... (amazon should have mentioned that this is the \"kettle potato chip review forum\"! : )i am happy to report that kettle chips, backyard barbeque flavour, are totally delicious!  (at least they are in the one-ounce bags...hopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same!)  these are definitely chips for adults, however -- and/or children whose stronger-than-adult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips.  they are not the strongest flavour i have ever had...that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me!these backyard barbeque chips by kettle, however, have just the right amount of sweetness, (with honey powder, onion and sugar), to take the edge of the stonger flavours(paprika, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, and natural smoke flavour), of which there is less, (they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners.)the complete list of ingredients of these kettle backyard barbecue chips, (in the 1-ounce bags, and hopefully, in the 9 ounce bags as well), is as follows:potatoesvegetable oil, (safflower and sunflower oil),honey powder, (dried cane sugar, honey),rice powdersugarsaltonion powdertomato powderpaprikatorula yeastgarlic powderchili peppercitric acidcayenne pepperpaprika oleoresin, (colour)natural smoke flavournaturally cooked, natural ingredients.  the combination is a true taste treat!of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key.potatoes contain a lot of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys.  the vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil, (as well as too much starch, from the potatoes), can hurt the eyes.  natural smoke flavour is so yummy....but it, (as well as sugar), has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer productionas far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, thiscan be ameliorated, (a bit), by drinking tea...which is good for the eyes.  but as far as the potassium, (energy - good, too much -- bad for the kidneys), and the sugar and natural smoke flavour, (too much leading to cancer production) -- the only thing is to do what is good in everything.....m o d e r a t i o n...!twice or three times a month, i allow myself to go on what i call a \"potato chip diet\".  i eat only one large bag, (or the equivalent in small ones), of potato chips all day.  i supplement this with tea, coffee, and lemonade, as well as several servings of carnation instant breakfast essentials, (i like the dark chocolate flavour)  this adds up to fewer calories than i would normally eat, if i had my normal three meals a day plus snacks.  it also teaches me to eat s-l-o-w-l-y, because that one big bag, (or many little bags), never lasts as long as i would like.  anyway, with excercise and sensible eating, the rest of the month, (and keeping my scale nearby, and weighing myself at least twice a day, every day), i have taken off ten pounds in the last three months! : )these backyard barbeque flavour potato chips from kettle,are totally scrumptious.  except for those jalapino chips, (which tasted good, but were far too spicy for my own taste buds), i have yet to meet a potato chip i did not like to eat.  these kettle backyard barbeque flavour potato chips, with their combination of potatoes, sweetness, and spices, have truly become one of my top five favourites....if not the very first favourite, of all!flavoured potato perfection!',\n",
